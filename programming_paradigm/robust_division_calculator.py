# This function takes two string inputs, converts them to floats, and performs division.
# It handles division by zero and type errors, returning appropriate messages.
# The result of the division or an error message is returned as a string.   

# Example usage:
# if __name__ == "__main__":    
#     print(safe_divide("10", "2"))  # Should print: The result of the division is 5.0
#     print(safe_divide("10", "0"))  # Should print: Error: Cannot divide by zero.
#     print(safe_divide("10", "abc"))  # Should print: Error: Please enter numeric values only.
# This code defines a function `safe_divide` that performs division with error handling.
